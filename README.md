# Whiteboard

This project was made in the purpose to create cool stuff. The main goal is create drafts and concepts of things we use everyday.

## Personal goals

Whiteboard has a secondary goal, which is to help me improve my written and spoken english.
English is not my native language, so this project will allow me to practice and communicate better within the community.

## Stack

- Next.js (app dir)
- Radix UI
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Contentlayer
